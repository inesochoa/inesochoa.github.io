Particle physicist working in the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiment at [CERN](https://cern.ch/).
La Caixa Postdoctoral Fellow at [LIP](https://www.lip.pt/).

## Short Bio

I joined LIP Lisbon in July 2020 as a [La Caixa Postdoctoral Fellow](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/la-caixa-foundation-postdoctoral-junior-leader-fellowships-incoming).

In 2010, I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at [Universidade de Coimbra](http://fisica.uc.pt/ax/main.php), where I am originally from. I moved to London in April 2011, to pursue a PhD at [University College London](http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/). I moved to New York in July of 2015, to work as a postdoctoral research associate at the [Nevis Laboratories](https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/), Columbia University. 


## Physics

### Research Interests
* Searches for new heavy particles with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC.
* Higgs and gauge bosons processes as a portal to new physics.
* Reconstruction and identification techniques for boosted Higgs bosons decaying to a pair of b-quarks.
* Anomaly detection for model-independent new physics searches at colliders.

[comment]: #* Jet substructure ([Run 1 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4945) and [Boosted H(bb) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04973))
[comment]: #* Higgs boson searches ([Run 1 VH(bb) paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6212))
[comment]: #* Electronics upgrade of LAr calorimeter

* Demonstrator at several ["Hands on Particle Physics"](http://physicsmasterclasses.org/) masterclasses in Coimbra and London.


## Music

* Double bass and electric bass player. Four years of music conservatory and many more of jazz school with regular live performances. 

* Short foray into portuguese pop/rock with [o rapaz estranho](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFEFEBC70AE5B69F).
