I am an experimental particle physicist at [LIP](https://www.lip.pt/) and I am based in Lisbon, Portugal. I am a member of the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) experiment at [CERN's](https://cern.ch/) Large Hadron Collider.

## Short Bio

In 2010, I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at [Universidade de Coimbra](http://fisica.uc.pt/ax/main.php), where I am originally from. I moved to London in April 2011 to pursue a PhD at [University College London](http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/). I moved to New York City in July of 2015 to work as a postdoctoral research associate at the [Nevis Laboratories](https://www.nevis.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. In July 2020 I was awarded a [La Caixa Junior Leader Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://fundacionlacaixa.org/en/la-caixa-foundation-postdoctoral-junior-leader-fellowships-incoming) and joined LIP. 


## Research Interest
* Searching for physics beyond the Standard Model at the Large Hadron Collider.
* CP-violation in Higgs boson interactions. 
* Machine learning methods for b-jet and Higgs boson tagging.
* Anomaly detection for model-agnostic searches for new physics.
* Differential programming applications in High Energy Physics.
