## Short Bio

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Columbia University. I moved to New York in July of 2015, a few months after completing my PhD at [University College London](http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/), having lived in London since 2011. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies in Physics at [Universidade de Coimbra](http://fisica.uc.pt/ax/main.php), where I am originally from. 

## Physics

The Large Hadron Collider is (literally) one of the coolest things in the Universe :) 

### Research highlights
* Searches for new physics in diboson fully-hadronic final states ([Latest public result](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2258132)){% comment %}
* b-tagging

* Jet substructure ([Boosted Higgs paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04973))
* Higgs boson searches ([Run 1 VH\\((b\bar{b})\\) result](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6212))
* Electronics upgrade of LAr calorimeter

### Teaching and Outreach

* Co-instructor at the [Science Honours Program](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/shp/calendar.html) Particle Physics course.
* Demonstrator at several "Hands on Particles" masterclasses in Coimbra and London.

## Music

* Double bass and electric bass player with four years of music conservatory education. Many more of jazz improvisation and theory lessons plus regular live performances. 

* Short foray into portuguese pop/rock with [o rapaz estranho](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBFEFEBC70AE5B69F).
